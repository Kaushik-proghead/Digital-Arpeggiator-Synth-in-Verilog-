Digital Arpeggiator Synth in Verilog 

- Designed and simulated a digital synthesizer in Verilog that generates musical notes using sine-wave lookup tables
- Implemented an arpeggiator module that cycles through chord tones in predefined patterns to create melodies
- Built with finite state machines, counters and memory arrays
- Verified functionality in simulation by exporting audio waveforms (.wav) to demonstrate real sound output
